It was renamed to its current name in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple has been described as a Big Tech company. \nThe company was founded to market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its successor, the Apple II, became one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984 as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal conflicts led to Jobs leaving the company to form NeXT and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as CEO for over a decade.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."},{"tool_name":"web_search","content":"- **Apple CEO Tim Cook's potential successors feature four top execs ...**\n  Another top contender is longtime Apple software chief Craig Federighi, who takes center stage each year at the tech giant’s high-profile Worldwide Developers Conference.
